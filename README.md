There are many small factors that slowly and gradually damage developer projects, so there are many basic points that every developer must master, in order to develop simple, successful, uncomplicated programs that are difficult to manage.

<h2> The most important points: </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <strong>Conceiving</strong>The Purpose of Software, thats mean, every developer need to understand the purpose of the software. There is, a single purpose of all software: To help people.
Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software, which is a complex system that doesnâ€™t help people that much. </li>

 <li><strong>Stop reinventing</strong> existing software that works well. </li>

 <li><strong>Measuring optimal</strong> code by making a small set of code that is easy to understand and read. </li>

 <li> Developers should make sure they <strong>fully understand the systems</strong> and tools they are working with to avoid developing complex systems. </li>

 <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> is the key to the success of various software development process, as a good developer creates software that is easy to understand so that it is really easy to get rid of all the bugs. </li>

 <li> <strong>Consistency</strong> is a big part of simplicity. So, if the developer do something one way in one place, he should do it that way in every place. For example, if he  name a variable thisIsVariable, then all of your variables should be named that way. </li>
</ul>
